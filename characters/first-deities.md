# First Deities - Monstrum Wiki

The first deities are the most powerful creatures in Monstrum. Monstrum created them to entertain himself because he is just a planet and enjoys watching the creatures living on him.  
The first deities have the most important roles, so Monstrum made sure they would be unkillable. If they somehow die, there will be a major catastrophe in the world.
