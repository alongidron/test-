# The Second Gods - Monstrum Wiki

The second gods were made by the first deities, the dragons, or by Monstrum. The second gods aren't as powerful as the first deities, though some have created their own magic. If one of them dies, nothing significant will happen because they can be replaced.  
Not all second gods consider themselves gods, and not all of them have important duties, but they are all very powerful creatures.
